The easiest way to insert travel allowance data is to use 'insert_travel_allowance.sh'.

Script's input: Year and month from the data to be inserted, ElasticSearch's user and password.
Example: ./insert_travel_allowance.sh 2016 10 myuser mypass
Example 2: ./insert_travel_allowance.sh 2014 11 myuser mypass

The other script's will be called by 'insert_travel_allowance.sh' correctly.
