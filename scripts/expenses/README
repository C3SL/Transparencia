The easiest way to insert expenses data is to use 'insert_expenses.sh'.

Script's input: Year, month and day from the data to be inserted, ElasticSearch's user and password. The day should be the last day of the month.
Example: ./insert_expenses.sh 2016 10 31 myuser mypass
Example 2: ./insert_expenses.sh 2014 11 30 myuser mypass

The other script's will be called by 'insert_expenses.sh' correctly.
