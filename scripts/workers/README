The easiest way to insert expenses data is to use 'insert_register_payment.sh'.

Script's input: Year and Month from CSV file, ElasticSearch's user and password.
Example (inserting data from file 20130930_Cadastro.csv): ./insert_register_payment.sh 2013 09 myuser mypassword
If you want to look at more examples, check add_registers.sh.

The other script's will be called by 'insert_register_payment.sh' correctly.
