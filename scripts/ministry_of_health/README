The easiest way to insert health ministry data is to use 'insert_ministry_of_health.sh'.

Script's input: Year, month and day from the data to be inserted, ElasticSearch's user and password. The day should be the last day of the month.
The script also uses a config file named 'config.sh'. This is a small shell script that need to only declare some variables: index, host and filter:
- Index: The index prefix to be saved on ElasticSearch.
- Host: The hostname of the machine runnning ElasticSearch.
- Filter: A string that will be used to 'egrep' the data obtained from Portal TransparÃªncia.

Example: ./insert_ministry_of_health.sh 2016 10 31 myuser mypass
Example 2: ./insert_ministry_of_health.sh 2014 11 30 power ranger

The other script's will be called by 'insert_ministry_of_health.sh' correctly.
